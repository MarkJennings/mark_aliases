# Overview
It's nice to have my common aliases on Git because I often work across several computers.

A few of these might be useful for others - feel free to take whatever you want.

I've also added a C++ Clang formatting file and various key bindings that I always forget.

## Install
1. `cd ~/Documents`
2. `git clone https://github.com/MarkJennings/mark_aliases.git`
3. Dependencies: `sudo apt-get install -y fortune cowsay pm-utils clang-format-10`
4. In your ~/.bashrc: `source ~/Documents/mark_aliases/aliases`
